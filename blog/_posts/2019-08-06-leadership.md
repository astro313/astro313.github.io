title: "Great Leader"

Reading [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/the-leader-youll-always-remember-is-the-one-who-cared-f92b821bcffa) reminds me of my interactions with my current supervisor/PhD advisor. She's very strict in some ways, a no non-sense person, someone with great vision, and a very good manager in my eyes. While I don't like to use the word "manager" in the research world since it should be collaborative, and creating hierarchy destroys the no-barrier discussions (on science). I like to ask questions and I want my supervisor to feel comfortable to let me know they don't know the answer when that's the case. 

Having spent a year with my current supervisor (RSS) and my biggest boss (of the Foundation I work for; JS), I spent some time to observe and identify patterns between good and bad leaders. I have to agree with the article, and in fact, I think both RSS and JS have made huge impacts on my life and will be forever remembered as my leader even when no day I no longer work for them directly. 

I admire their leadership skills and I hope that one day, someone would say similar things to me.
