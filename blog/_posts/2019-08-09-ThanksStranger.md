One advantage of being in a big city like NYC is of course all the things happening in the city! I attended the meetup group: women who codes this week. While I have a totally different background than everyone else in the room, who knows a lot about front end and back end development, while my research doesn't require that kind of skills, I received some help from Luna on fixing some CSS design of my research website. Thanks Luna, who was a stranger to me before I went to the meetup. 

I can't thank her enough for fixing some asthetic issues on my website that's been bothering me. 

Isn't it nice to collaborate with people who have different skillsets than you?!
