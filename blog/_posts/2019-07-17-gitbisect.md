title: "Debug using Git Bisect"

I have been using git for many years. I am not a sophisticated user, but I use it for collaboration and basic version control of projects. I came across `git bisect` while taking a quiz on linkedin to find out how much do I actually know about `git`.

I found a cool video online explaining what it does: https://www.penta-code.com/how-to-quickly-find-buggy-commits-with-git-bisect/

I suppose this could be useful for the code I am building with a few others.
