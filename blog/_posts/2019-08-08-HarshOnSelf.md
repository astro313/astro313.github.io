title: "Too Harsh on Myself"

While I acknowledge my feelings and anxiety dealing with uncertainties, I often find that this stems from the way I treat myself. 

## Why are you so harsh on yourself?
Over years, I've been asked the same question by different people I met at different stages of life. Except when I was growing up in Hong Kong, of course, where I was constantly being told that I am not putting in enough effort or I am not doing enough this or that. 

I wonder if the standards I hold myself up to comes from how I was brought up...

I would very much love to find out how we can "rewire" our brains to unlearn the learned.
