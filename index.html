     <p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Daisy Leung</span> and I study the universe we all live in.</p>
     <p>I get by as an astronomer, and photographer living in Upstate New York and working at <a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~tleung">Cornell University</a>. Most of my projects are about distant galaxies that formed billions years ago. My daily work involves coding in Python and Bash and also using other astronomical softwares. Outside of work, I love nature and would like to spend more time traveling and exploring this "pale blue dot". </p>

      <p><a href="mailto:leungtszkuk@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a> about your project if you're interested in collaborating with me,
    or about your travel plans if you're interested in traveling together. </p>
