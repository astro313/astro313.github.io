     <p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">T. K. Daisy Leung</span> and I study the universe we all live in.</p>
     <p>I get by as an astrophysicist/research scientist living in New York City. I work at <a href='https://www.simonsfoundation.org/'>The Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute</a> and <a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~tleung">Cornell University</a>. My research projects focus on understanding the formation and evolution of distant galaxies that had formed billions years ago. My daily work involves data analysis, modeling, handling large datasets, coding in Python and Bash, interacting with other scientists, and a lot of writing. Outside of work, I love spending time outside appreciating mother nature. I would love to spend more time traveling and exploring this "pale blue dot"! </p>

      <p><a href="mailto:leungtszkuk@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a> about your project if you're interested in collaborating,
    or your travel plans if you're interested in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tszkuk">traveling together</a>. The top destinations on my list are Eastern Europe and Mongolia. </p>
