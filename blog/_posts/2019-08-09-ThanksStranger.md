One advantage of being in a city like NYC is of course all the things happening in the city! I attended this meetup group: "women who codes" for the first time this week. I got some help from one of the attendees (Luna) to fix some CSS code of my research website, which I had spent an embarrasing amount of time on.

Thanks Luna, who was a stranger to me before I went to the meetup. 

Isn't it nice to collaborate with people who have different skillsets than you?!
