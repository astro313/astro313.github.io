### Apple or Not?
I have been using Apple's iphone since the first generation. I was using Nokia and Sony Ericsson prior to that. I have been debating whether or not to get a new phone (I am still using the truly mobile-size iphone SE) -- mainly tempted by the huge improvements seen on the cell phone cameras. 

My friends amazed me with the low light/night mode on the Google Pixel phone and Huawei phones, while another recently took some amazing photos of me and a helicopter using the wide angle lens on his Samsung. 

I would argue that I have very high standards for photos. I therefore always bring my DSLR for my photo trips, together with a few other lenses and my tripod. The problem obviosuly is that the weight of my gears adds up quickly. There are times where I don't need to take professional level photos (i.e., capturing huge dynamic range while maintaining good sharpness and noise control), but the camera on my iphone SE is clearly subpar for my standards. 

I checked out a bunch of phones at Best Buy. I concluded that I still prefer the UI on iphones over other android phones, especially since I use Macbooks and synchronize all the events on my calender across Apple devices.

Most of my friends have the same Mac + iphone combo like me, others have the Windows/Linux + Google/Android combo, and a few have the Apple Macbook + Google combo (P.S. they work for Google). But a pattern is seen across. Once you become accustomed to a certain UI, it takes some time and energy to learn a different one, so you tend to stick with it. I think this is one of the reasons why Apple is capable of selling ever more expensive iphones and ipads... 

Similarly, once we are accustomed to certain beliefs, definitions (e.g., of beauty), and standards, it is very hard to appreciate others' ___ (opinions, beliefs, preferences, brands, etc). 

From the business angle, it's smart to "take advantage" of this human flaw. From my point of view, I like to (at least try to) be conscious of all the decisions I make.
