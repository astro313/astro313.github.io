title: "My Writing Sucks"

Lately, I've been asked to write a lot, mostly describing my research to other non-experts in the field, or to students in other fields, etc. In the process, I realized I am a much better writer than I was. I am still far from good at it, but my writing really sucked in the past. 

There's one person I should perhaps thank. I don't recall any training from them, it could be that my writing skill has improved through practice and reading a lot. But I don't like to take things for granted, so let's assume that I should be appreciative of them. 

In any case, this struck me to realize how much people can change over time/with age. I used to dislike writing and reading. I found all the book recommended by my school teacher to be boring. Nobody ever cared to convince me that I should read certain books, other than the quizzes and exams, and the fact that my parent would punish me for getting a low grade. 

Fast forward to 15+ years later, I have transformed into someone who finds joy and peace in reading and writing. 

Guess, one should never judge a person by who they are today. You will never know... not even myself.
