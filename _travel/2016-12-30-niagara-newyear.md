On Dec 30th, Sean Goebel and I drove ~3.5 hours to Niagara Falls from Ithaca. We got there pretty early despite the snow. We dropped off our stuff in Quality Inn (great value for the price) and waited until it was getting dark and took off to have dinner. It was pretty cold that day and it was snowing a lot. We got pretty worried about not seeing the fireworks. But luckily, it stopped snowing just an hour before the fireworks. We had dinner and walked toward the parkway. The fireworks started very soon when we got there, otherwise we would have walked up to the Rainbow Bridge for better shots. 
Surprsingly, the fireworks only lasted ~5 min!! Argh. We were expecting at least 15 minutes. In Hong Kong, where I grew up, the fireworks would last for >20 minutes! It was a bit unfortunate. Perhaps we have longer fireworks on New Year's Eve? But the hotels were pretty booked (or super expensive) when we booked our the hotel. Oh well. It was my 2nd time visiting Niagara Falls in the winter. I then visited again in June 2017 with my mother, which I will update with photos very soon.
