I have strong resilence against new tech products (e.g., latest smartphones, home assistants like Alexa) mainly because of 1) privacy issues; 2) I'm more focused on need over want; 3) I prefer to be the producer/designer than the user; 4) I prefer not to rely on techologies too much that I may forget how to live without them.

### Privacy Issues
The fact that I am using a smartphone, laptops, credit cards, and the internet pretty much mean that my information is already out there. Frankly, my resistence is just a psychologically effect to make myself feel like I still have control over my privacy.

If I have to give in to e.g., a smartwatch or a home assistant, it would be because I am interested in learning something about myself that the data these devices are collecting can reveal. If these companies are taking advantage of my data, then so should I be able to! (This is why I am still on Facebook...)

### Need over Want
I have had some bumpy rides growing up where my family struggled some financial difficulties. I've always been told that I should think about my needs over want, and that I should sit on the idea of buying something for a night before actually buying it. This habit has stuck with me, and perhaps gone too far - I debated for months before buying a TV, which ironically, I didn't end up using much (and my adorable sister took advantage of that).

### Producer vs Consumer
I don't like to be led by the nose. Therefore, I don't chase after new products or latest models. I like to think of ways to counteract the psychological states that companies are trying to target at their customers. (But I'm inevitably biased - I wouldn't say my desire to buy a better camera lens is led by the nose...) I prefer to be among those to create the products and tools that others find useful. 

### Survival Skills
I think point 4 is pretty self-explanatory. While it is important to keep up with the society as the world evolve, but if the market/world moves too fast, it will hit a recession. I'd like to stay prepared by having the skills to survive without these products. Would we still know how to navigate with (or without) traditional maps (and not google map)? 

### My Wish List
However, there are products two products that I would love to have. 

First, a watch that sends a vibration to remind me ~5-10 min ahead another meeting. This way, I can politely wrap up the current one without abnoxiously checking the clock during a meeting. But I don't want to have the other functions a smartwatch offers. I don't need to get an instant notification when I get a text/an email! I should be the one to decide when I want to read my emails and not the other way. 

Second, I would love a model of the iphone that has the wide angle lens like the iphone 11, but the size of an SE! Until then, I will stick with my iphone SE.
