Mother and I drove to Niagara Falls from Ithaca today. We left at ~10 am and stopped at Canton House around noon for dim sum. We arrived at Niagara pretty early. We parked on the street ~2 blocks away, and I don't remember how much it costs anymore, something reasonable - $3-5 per hour? We first stopped at the Observation Deck and each paid ~$2 to enter. It was packed with people! Aiya Aiya.. Here's a photo of my mother and the Rainbow Bridge taken there.

I have more photos taken there to be uploaded...

Then we took off and drove to Canada. Here's a photo taken on the Rainbow Bridge as we were waiting in "car queue" to cross. We waited ~10 minutes before our turn. We answered a few basic questions e.g. how long are you staying, where are you going, and drove to the first parking spot right by Rainbow Bridge. It costs ~$5 CAD to park for 30 minutes which we did. And we were sort of lucky to find a spot very quickly, though most people only stopped for 30 minutes or so. We then walked up to Rainbow Bridge ($0.5 USD per person to enter) to shoot a few photos as were didn't have time to do so while driving across.  <br>

Then we returned to our car. Before we do so, we have to cross the boarder again (glad that we brought our passports). We were being asked a similar set of questions. Given how hot it was (>30 Celcius), I'd rather not pay for expensive parking while having to walk ~4 miles back and forth the parkway to the Horseshoe Fall. So we drove toward that direction and found street parking and pay something reasonable (~$5 CAD per hour) and it was much closer to where we wanted to go. <br>

We were gonna spend a night in Toronto, but something happened :( We left Niagara around 7pm and got home by midnight. It was my first time at Niagara Falls in the summer, and it was packed with people, >4x more crowded than in winter.
