I am giving a seminar at Harvard University this week. As I arrived at the Amtrak Station in Boston, I had the option to either figure out how to take public transportations or just take an Uber to my Airbnb. I had a small carry-on item with me and I am physically fit to lug it around. I decided to take an Uber - not becuase the Institute is paying for it, but because I had other important things to do once I settled at the Airbnb. Taking the extra time to figure out my ways in Boston - especially given that I am only staying for a few days - would seem rather unwise.

I am pretty sure that I would have took the train + bus + some walking if I were a college student. 

I always try to tell myself that I should be spending the same amount of money regardless of the amount I am making. But when I am in such position, my time would be more valuable, and suddenly, the amount of money I'd have to use will also increase. It would seem rather impractical to spend the same amount of money in absolute form.
