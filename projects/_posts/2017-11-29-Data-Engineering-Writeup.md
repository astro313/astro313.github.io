Finally, the [final writeup report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dzGzYDB02mmEoYh97ZZx8tN-0pfgI3UtdBhv9vTcGsA/edit?usp=sharing) on *Performance of Costly Functions* is submitted...

It summarizes what we have explored and learned since end of Mid/End of October. It wasn't a lot of time (given that we only worked on this "side project" at most 10 hours per week), but to me, it was truly a memorable experience to work with a team of non-astronomers! I was quite happy to work in pair with a team member, so that we can be equally miserable (sarcastic) or we can try to figure out the solution together.
