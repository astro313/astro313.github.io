Finally got around to put together a website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and git. 
I can use Markdown to author my posts! It seem easier to work with than wordpress for putting up codes.
Following [Jonathan Mcglone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages), making a website with Jekyll is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
