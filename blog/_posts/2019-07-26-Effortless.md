# Definition of Effort for AI
When AI are so good at calculating, solving problems, writing a paper, a novel, handling large data and finding trends, I am not sure what effort means anymore. We go through years of education and training to be good at what we do, but I don't think the word "effort" is meaningful for AIs. 

# AIs versus classic computers 
When people invented computers, which are capable of carrying out complex calculations and simulations, we would never use the word effort on computers but that didn't bother me since human inputs are still required. We have to tell the computers how to do the calculations. But with AI, we still don't understand why they work so well and we lack a thorough mathemtical understanding of what's under the hood. 

It bothers me to imagine a world where AI can do most of the work effortlessly.
